# About

Daocun Yang's submission for NextCapital's programming exercise. <br /><br />

My solution makes partial use of <a href="https://github.com/BLC/bowling-api-client">this provided API</a>. My solution also doesn't make use of database or back-end technologies; instead it uses HTML5 web storage to simulate user sign up and log in. In addition to the minimum requirments specified by the documentation, my solution also allows a user to set starting balance for bowlers, as well as choosing game difficulty.   

# Live Demo

# Functionalities
<ul>
<li>Sign Up</li>
<li>Log In</li>
<li>Log Out</li>
<li>Set starting balance for bowlers (default to $50)</li>
<li>Choose difficulty (default to easy)</li>
<li>View current jackpot</li>
<li>Let bowlers buy tickets for the current jackpot</li>
<li>Draw a winning ticket for a jackpot</li>
<li>Record the result of the jackpot roll and then see the next jackpot</li>
<li>Win games!!!</li>
</ul>

# Technologies

# Thoughts
I would like to thank NextCapital for giving me this programming exercise, since I truly enjoyed the process of completing this challenge and building the game. It helps me to review some front-end knowledge, makes me think about user experience, as well as familiarize myself with Git and Github (I've only used Subversion before for school projects). This exercise also leads me to realize the need to learn more about the back-end. I'm currently teaching myself Ruby on Rails, which I hope to master by the start of next summer.
